                I couldn't really think of a favorite place, so excuse my
                cheesy answer, but my favorite place is wherever my family
                is. Pictured to the left are my mom, and my two adorable
                nieces, Thea and Addie. Addie is the one sucking the lollipop.

                Something you would never expect is that I enjoy singing and
                am taking gospel choir this semester.
